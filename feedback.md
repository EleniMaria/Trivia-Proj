## Code Quality

Progressing - Your HTML looks really good -- awesome job with that, love that you used semantic elements like `header` and `footer`. Your code is well formatted throughout as well. I would love to see more CSS and for your JavaScript to be DRY-ed up -- you could do so pretty straightforwardly from where you're at. Look at the code that's repeated from question to question. I would also remove console.logs in production code

## Technical Requirements

Progressing - Your app meets the MVP for trivia!

## Creativity & Interface

Progressing - I'd keep working on the styling and making the interface really user friendly! 

## Functionality

Progressing - Your game works as expected!

## Presentation

Progressing - I like a lot of the content in your readme! I'd use markdown to format it.

Good job on this project, I know the process was difficult but you got there!
